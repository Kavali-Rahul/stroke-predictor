# ðŸ§  Stroke Risk Prediction Web App

This project is a machine learning-based web app to predict the risk of stroke in a patient based on health and lifestyle factors. It also provides visual comparisons of the patient's health data with the general population.

## Features

- Predict stroke risk using a Random Forest model
- Compares:
  - Age
  - BMI
  - Glucose levels
- Interactive charts for visualization
- Shows patient health status analysis
- Easy to use web interface (built with Streamlit)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo or upload it to Streamlit Cloud
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run stroke_app.py

stroke_prediction_project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ stroke_app.py                # Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ stroke_data.csv              # Dataset used for visualization
â”œâ”€â”€ saved_model/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stroke_rf_model.pkl      # Trained model
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature_columns.pkl      # Feature list
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ best_threshold.txt       # Optimal threshold value

## dataset
This app uses a modified version of the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.

ðŸ“Š Output Example
ðŸ”´ High Risk of Stroke (Probability: 0.78)

ðŸŸ¢ Your BMI is in the average range

ðŸ”´ Your glucose level is higher than most people
